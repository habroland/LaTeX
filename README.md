LaTeX code

In titleCounter you will find a small piece of code you can customize to make your own file with a title that updates with a counter.
Concretely, I used it to make a file that is called "How to do X in N easy steps", where N is the number of steps. N gets updated every time you add an environment called "step". For a neat example, see https://www.overleaf.com/read/bswqhjmfmcwt
